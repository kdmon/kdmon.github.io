          <p class="lead">I take a take an agile development approach, building flexibility and quality assurance into the project life cycle. By working in short iterations and close to my customers, I rapidly gain a full understanding of requirements; meanwhile clients get to follow my progress and can input early in the process.

            <h3>Learning from what has gone before</h3>
            <p>I won't re-invent the wheel. By leveraging the value of open source and its global pool of software developers, I am able to focus limited resources where it matters most. By re-using existing open source software, I can use the pareto principle to meet up to 80% of client needs without writing a single line of code. I can then spend most of my time addressing key requirements through value-adding custom development. Thus, delivering high quality tried-and-tested solutions in short time frames, at affordable rates and tailored to fully meet client needs.

            <h3>Leaving a positive mark on everything I do</h3>
            <p>
              There is a well known shortage of affordable ICT skills and services for social economy organisations. I operate on the social enterprise principle and will re-invest a portion of my earnings to subsidise ICT projects for cash-strapped organisations that deliver important social impacts.
