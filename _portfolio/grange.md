        The Grange Audio Guide retells the rich history of the Grange area of Edinburgh, adapting which stories are told according to the physical (GPS) location and preferences of the user. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I designed and evaluated the system as part of a six month dissertation project during my Masters in Informatics at the University of Edinburgh. The guide was created using the Google Maps API, the HTML5 audio and positioning APIs, as well as the speech synthesis API offered by Cereproc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked with a local community group, the Grange Association, to trial the system and presented the evaluation results at the 2013 NordiCHI workshop on Audience Engagement.
