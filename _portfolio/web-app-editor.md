    The Web App Editor is an online collaborative authoring tool designed
    to make it easy to create, test and publish responsive web applications.
    It integrates with the Github.com API to make it easy to get started 
    with source control.

      <h2>Responsibilities</h2>
      <p>
        Inspired by cloud-based code editors, I created and piloted the WAE over several years while I was teaching web programming to beginners and conducting action research in the healthcare sector. Using feedback from students and research participants, I gradually improved it and added new features, such as: real-time collaborative editing, file handling, a more configurable user interface, chat, video conferencing, and more.

      <h2>Achievements</h2>
      <p>The editor came to play a critical role in my teaching and collaborative design research activities. I also use it frequently in both professional and hobby projects because it speeds up the prototyping process by making visualising and modifying concepts quick.</p>

      It was impressive how it almost "transfers" what you're working on onto your phone [...] 
      So you can run your test device separately from the computer where you're programming 
      using the editor.

        I found the editor very valuable to my project. There are some features which I donâ€™t know where else I would have found them.
