        The SBC App is a mobile learning intervention aimed at Healthcare Practitioners in Transfusion Medicine. It aims to promote the correct use of irradiated and Cytomegalovirus negative blood components, a challening area where mistakes a frequently reported due to inadequate practitioner knowledge.

      <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
      <p>
        I created the SBC app as part of my PhD research in collaboration with the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service and others. I worked on every aspect of the app, from concept development, requirements analysis, prototyping, gaining ethical clearing, developing learning materials, managing collaborations with partners, formative and summative evaluation, and so on.
      </p>
      <h3>Achievements</h3>
      <p>
        Designed as an interoperable Web App, it supports current smartphone, tablet and desktop computers, as well as legacy systems used in the National Health Service (down to IE 6). 
      </p>
      <p>
        In a randomised controlled pilot study with 61 healthcare staff from three Scottish hospitals, knowledge of safe transfusion practice doubled after the app was used. Furthermore, feedback was very positive and 90% of participants said they would recommended it to others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also presented the app to 300+ doctors, nurses and other professionals at the  meetings of the British Blood Transfusion Society and Serious Hazards of Transfusion. One of my abstracts won the Serious Hazards of Transfusion Best Abstract prize.
