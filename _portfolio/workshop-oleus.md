      I co-organised a three day multidisciplinary workshop aiming to familiarise craftspersons and students from diverse backgrounds to 3D printing technology and rapid prototyping.
    </p>
        
    <h2>Responsibilities and achievements</h2>
      <p>
      Working as a team of three, I planned and faciliated each step of the workshop. It started of with an ideation phase where participants were encouraged to develop ideas with paper, plasticine and wool. We also introduced  digital photography as a way to capture physical objects using photogrammetry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once concepts were ready, participants moved on to realising them using the 3D modelling package Sculptris. The designs were then fabricated using professional and entry-level 3D printers, and the workshop concluded with a focus group discussing the outcomes with participants.
