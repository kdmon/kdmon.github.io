      This piece, part of an exhibition by the artists Nicole Heidtke and Stefan Baumberger, enable the public to experience a myriorama -- assembled by visitors in the Inspace exhibition space -- by looking through a <q>digital telescope</q> mounted in St. Andrew's Square park, in Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      My role in this project was to tackle the engineering issues involved in realising the artistic vision of Stefan and Nicole. When I got involved they were grappling with a number of unresolved technical challenges and were working to a tight deadline before the opening night.
    </p>
    <h3>Achievements</h3>
    <p>
      I wrote and tested the application and back-end server that made the telescope work. I designed the application so that the myriorama would move in sync with the telescope's physical movement (detected by the embedded gyroscopic sensor) and would automatically detect when new myrioramas had been created in the exhibition space, and refreshed the telescope view. 
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify the system and greatly improve performance, I wrote a computer script to pre-generate all three thousand possible combinations of images. Additionally, I helped debug and test other parts of the system, including those which used machine vision algorithms to identify active images.
