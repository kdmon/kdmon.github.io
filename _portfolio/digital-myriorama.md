      <q>Yen To See Distant Places</q> is part of an exhibition by the artists Nicole Heidtke and Stefan Baumberger that allows the audience to explore a customisable myriorama -- assembled by visitors in the Inspace exhibition space -- by looking through a telescope mounted in St. Andrew's Square park, in Edinburgh.
    </p>
    <h3><i class="fa fa-fw fa-check-square-o"></i> Responsibilities</h3>
    <p>
      My role in this project was to tackle engineering issues involved in realising the artistic vision of Stefan and Nicole. When I got involved, they were grappling with a number of unresolved technical challenges and were working to a tight deadline before the opening night.
    </p>
    <h3><i class="fa fa-fw fa-trophy"></i> Achievements</h3>
    <p>
      Working in a team of five, I wrote and tested the software application and back-end server that powered the telescope. I designed the application so that the myriorama would move in sync with the telescope's physical movement, which was tracked by an embedded gyroscopic sensor. I also created a mechanism for transmitting configurations of images created in exhibition space to ensure the telescope myriorama was updated.
    </p>
    <p>
      To simplify the system and greatly improve performance, I wrote a computer script to pre-generate three thousand possible combinations of images. Additionally, I helped debug and test other parts of the system, including components which used machine vision algorithms to identify active myriorama cards.
