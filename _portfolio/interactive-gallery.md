      This interactive web application allows the user to freely move around and explore the artwork in a dynamically generated exhibition space, populated by avatars and my father's paintings.

    <h3>Responsibilities and achievements</h3>
    <p>
      I created the gallery from scratch using the 3D javascript library Three.JS.
      The gallery features animated avatars, subtle lighting and ambient sounds. These features are toggled through a simple user interface. There is also a high quality mode, which will load higher resolution images for users with fast internet connections.
